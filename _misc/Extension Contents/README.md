# Contents of an Extension

The contents of an extension are stored in a folder

An extension should contain a manifest file called <b>manifest.json</b>

It could optionally contain:
* HTML pages (custom pages, background.html etc. HTML pages need not be provided if the extension is a theme)
* JavaScript files including libraries (eg. content scripts, jQuery)
* images 
* Flash movies etc.

NOTE: The HTML pages cannot contain embedded scripts
