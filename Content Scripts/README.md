#Content Scripts 

A Content Script is any arbitrary CSS and JavaScript that are injected into selected pages and executed similar to user scripts. It becomes part of the loaded page just like the user scripts. 

A Content Script uses in-page UI and takes up no UI in the browser. 

A Content Script has direct contact with web pages, but has less privileges when compared to a background page which has more privileges but is isolated from direct contact with web pages. 

A Content Script cannot directly modify the browser UI and the DOM of the HTML pages that are packaged with the extension like the UI and the background pages can.
